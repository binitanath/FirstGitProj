# FirstGitProj
This is my first repository and am learning about how GitHub works.
I started my technical professional way back in 2000 and after 7 years of working in different technologies took a break to raise my kids. I am back again to start off where I left. Lots have changed in terms of technological advances but need to be proficient in web technologies. This is a learning phase for me.
